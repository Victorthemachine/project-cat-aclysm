**Currently work in progress, updates coming soon.**

Hello and welcome to my little repository.

I introduce you to a rewritten version of Nya~bot with robust server and webpage integration. Main aim is at user comfort and visualization of more complicated commands. Additionally, proper music, managment and other support for your server use. Both as a member and an owner.

It's very fun having to rewrite everything to slash and it's so well documented and intuitive that I am not tearing out my hair at all
